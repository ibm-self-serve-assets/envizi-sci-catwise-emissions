# Leverage SCI Advanced Configurations to Report Emissions by Custom Categories

This guide provides a clear, step-by-step approach for reporting and summarizing emissions in SCI (Supply Chain Intelligence) by custom categoriesâ€”such as Category 1 (Purchased Goods & Services) and Category 2 (Capital Goods). This helps organizations meet detailed reporting and regulatory requirements with ease.

## 1. Understanding the Default Envizi SCI Scope 3 Summary Dashboard

By default, the Scope 3 Summary dashboard in SCI summarizes emissions on a monthly basis at the location level for each GHG (Greenhouse Gas) calculation method, such as:

- Spend-based
- Average-data
- Hybrid
- Supplier-specific

<div align="center">

</div>

In the example above, there are three locations:

- INBank-APAC-Ops
- INBank-EMEA-Ops
- INBank-US-Ops

Each location consolidates emissions by calculation method (e.g., "spend-based"). If other methods are used, the platform automatically groups emissions accordingly, so you may see multiple entries per location.

When you export these monthly emissions, an export job is created for each method and sent to Envizi automatically.

**Example export job:**

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/Scope3-Summary-Export-Jan24-Job.png">
</div>

In Envizi, you can find the exported file under:

`Admin > Data Flow Automation > File Delivery Status`

<div align="center">

</div>

Once the job is complete and the data is processed, you can view the results in the respective accounts for each location. For example, here is the data for `INBank-APAC-Ops`:

<div align="center">
  <img src="Images/Envizi-APAC-Ops-SpendAcc.png">
</div>

</div>

## 2. Why Separate Emissions by Scope 3 Category?

Some organizations require emissions to be reported separately for each Scope 3 category. For example, instead of exporting all spend-based emissions for all locations as a single group, you may need to break them down by specific categories.

The most common categories are:

- **Category 1:** Purchased Goods & Services (PG&S)
- **Category 2:** Capital Goods (CG)

The GHG protocol calculation logic is the same for both categories, so SCI can be configured to calculate and report them simultaneously.

There are two main approaches in SCI for capturing and reporting these categories separately:

1. **Purchasing organization-based approach**
2. **Product category-based approach**

For more details, see the [IBM documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/envizi-supply-chain?topic=configuration-configuring-category-1-2).

In this guide, we use the product category-based approach, as chosen by our example organization, IN Bank. The following sections explain how to achieve this in SCI.
